## 📱 iOS capture handoff

The companion iOS app can hand a fresh [Apple RoomPlan](https://developer.apple.com/augmented-reality/roomplan/) scan directly to the web editor via Firebase Storage:

1. The iOS app uploads the RoomPlan `room.json` to Firebase Storage at `inbox/{CODE}.json` in the `openplan3d.firebasestorage.app` bucket, where `CODE` is 8 characters from `[A-Z2-9]` (I, O, 0 and 1 are excluded to avoid ambiguity).
2. The app shows a QR code / link of the form:

   ```
   https://app.openplan3d.com/editor?import=CODE
   ```

3. When the editor opens with an `import` query param, it downloads the JSON straight from Firebase Storage (no SDK needed):

   ```
   https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/openplan3d.firebasestorage.app/o/inbox%2F{CODE}.json?alt=media
   ```

   and imports it through the regular RoomPlan pipeline (default options: straighten + orthogonal), creating a new project. On success the `import` param is replaced with the new project's `id` so a refresh won't re-import.

Access is controlled by [`storage.rules`](storage.rules): public **read** and **create** are allowed only on `inbox/{CODE}.json` (content type `application/json`, < 10 MB); updates, deletes, and everything else in the bucket are denied.

### One-time setup (project owner)

1. **Enable Storage** for the `openplan3d` project in the [Firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/openplan3d/storage) if it isn't already.
2. **Deploy the rules:**

   ```bash
   firebase deploy --only storage
   ```

3. **Auto-delete stale captures** — set a lifecycle rule that deletes objects under the `inbox/` prefix after 1 day (prefix-scoped lifecycle uses `matchesPrefix`). Save this as `lifecycle.json`:

   ```json
   {
     "rule": [
       {
         "action": { "type": "Delete" },
         "condition": { "age": 1, "matchesPrefix": ["inbox/"] }
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

   Then apply it with either:

   ```bash
   gcloud storage buckets update gs://openplan3d.firebasestorage.app --lifecycle-file=lifecycle.json
   # or
   gsutil lifecycle set lifecycle.json gs://openplan3d.firebasestorage.app
   ```
